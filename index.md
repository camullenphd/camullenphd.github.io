My dissertation examines the practices of Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMA), a volunteer-run and user-generated community archive that aims to celebrate and preserve music from Greater Manchester, the large metropolitan area including and surrounding the city of Manchester, England. In each chapter of the dissertation, I focus on a different aspect of MDMA's work, from its website and programming efforts, to the affect of the archive process and the place within larger networks of heritage work and popular music preservation in Manchester.

Chapter 2 looks at the purpose and usage of MDMA's digital archive by engaging in an analysis of the MDMA website. Through a manual analysis of website's characteristics and functionalities and a digital humanities-based analysis of the website's content, this chapter weaves together ethnographic investigation with data-based visualizations to describe the archive's structure and how it is utilized by its network of users. Here, on my website, you can explore some of the visualizations that contribute to this analysis.
