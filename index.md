**Explore My Dissertation**

My dissertation examines the practices of Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMA), a volunteer-run and user-generated community archive that aims to celebrate and preserve music from Greater Manchester, the large metropolitan area including and surrounding the city of Manchester, England. In each chapter of the dissertation, I focus on a different aspect of MDMA's work, from its website and programming efforts, to the affect of the archival process and the place within larger networks of heritage work and popular music preservation in Manchester.

Chapter 2 looks at the purpose and usage of MDMA's digital archive by engaging in an analysis of the MDMA website. Through a manual analysis of website's characteristics and functionalities and a digital humanities-based analysis of the website's content, this chapter weaves together ethnographic investigation with data-based visualizations to describe the archive's structure and how it is utilized by its network of users. Here, on my website, you can explore some of the visualizations that contribute to this analysis.

***Archival Content and Growth***

The extent of MDMA's archival content and its growth since launching as a user-generated archive help to understand what subject matter is prevalent in the archive and how archival expansion has occurred over time.

**Figure 3** (LINK), a bubble chart showing the popularity of the tags included in the data set, illustrates the proportion of tagged items associated with particular tags and tag types in the archive. Click through to read more about the bubble chart.

**Figure 4** (LINK), a stacked bar graph comparing the sum of artifacts uploaded to the dates of upload, demonstrates how and where the archive's holdings have grown by examining tag types and separating tags into popularity segments within type. On this page, you can learn more about how growth occurs and the methods for determining popularity within type.
